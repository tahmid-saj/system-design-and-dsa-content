# Load balancing

Load Balancer (LB) is another critical component of any distributed system. It helps to spread the traffic across a cluster of servers to improve responsiveness and availability of applications, websites or databases. LB also keeps track of the status of all the resources while distributing requests. If a server is not available to take new requests or is not responding or has elevated error rate, LB will stop sending traffic to such a server.

## Load balancing introduction

Typically a load balancer sits between the client and the server accepting incoming network and application traffic and distributing the traffic across multiple backend servers using various algorithms. By balancing application requests across multiple servers, a load balancer reduces the load on individual servers and prevents any one server from becoming a single point of failure, thus improving overall application availability and responsiveness.

To utilize full scalability and redundancy, we can try to balance the load at each layer of the system. We can add LBs at three places:

- Between the user and the web server
- Between web servers and an internal platform layer, like application servers or cache servers
- Between internal platform layer and database.

### Load balancing advantages

- Users experience faster, uninterrupted service. Users won’t have to wait for a single struggling server to finish its previous tasks. Instead, their requests are immediately passed on to a more readily available resource.

- Service providers experience less downtime and higher throughput. Even a full server failure won’t affect the end user experience as the load balancer will simply route around it to a healthy server.

- Load balancing makes it easier for system administrators to handle incoming requests while decreasing wait time for users.

- Smart load balancers provide benefits like predictive analytics that determine traffic bottlenecks before they happen. As a result, the smart load balancer gives an organization actionable insights. These are key to automation and can help drive business decisions.

- System administrators experience fewer failed or stressed components. Instead of a single device performing a lot of work, load balancing has several devices perform a little bit of work.

### Load balancing terminology

#### Load Balancer

A device or software that distributes network traffic across multiple servers based on predefined rules or algorithms.

#### Backend Servers

The servers that receive and process requests forwarded by the load balancer. Also referred to as the server pool or server farm.

#### Load Balancing Algorithm

The method used by the load balancer to determine how to distribute incoming traffic among the backend servers.

#### Health Checks

Periodic tests performed by the load balancer to determine the availability and performance of backend servers. Unhealthy servers are removed from the server pool until they recover.

#### Session Persistence

A technique used to ensure that subsequent requests from the same client are directed to the same backend server, maintaining session state and providing a consistent user experience.

#### SSL/TLS Termination

The process of decrypting SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic at the load balancer level, offloading the decryption burden from backend servers and allowing for centralized SSL/TLS management.

### How do load balancers work?

Load balancers work by distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources to ensure efficient utilization of computing resources and prevent overload. Here are the general steps that a load balancer follows to distribute traffic:

1. The load balancer receives a request from a client or user.
2. The load balancer evaluates the incoming request and determines which server or resource should handle the request. This is done based on a predefined load-balancing algorithm that takes into account factors such as server capacity, server response time, number of active connections, and geographic location.
3. The load balancer forwards the incoming traffic to the selected server or resource.
4. The server or resource processes the request and sends a response back to the load balancer.
5. The load balancer receives the response from the server or resource and sends it to the client or user who made the request.

Note: The servers could also directly send the response back to the client, without the response first going to the load balancer

## Load balancing algorithms

A load balancing algorithm is a method used by a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic and requests among multiple servers or resources. The primary purpose of a load balancing algorithm is to ensure efficient utilization of available resources, improve overall system performance, and maintain high availability and reliability.

Load balancing algorithms help to prevent any single server or resource from becoming overwhelmed, which could lead to performance degradation or failure. By distributing the workload, load balancing algorithms can optimize response times, maximize throughput, and enhance user experience. These algorithms can consider factors such as server capacity, active connections, response times, and server health, among others, to make informed decisions on how to best distribute incoming requests.

### How does the load balancer choose the backend server?

Load balancers consider two factors before forwarding a request to a backend server. They will first ensure that the server they choose is actually responding appropriately to requests and then use a pre-configured algorithm to select one from the set of healthy servers. We will discuss these algorithms shortly.

Health Checks - Load balancers should only forward traffic to "healthy" backend servers. To monitor the health of a backend server, "health checks" regularly attempt to connect to backend servers to ensure that servers are listening. If a server fails a health check, it is automatically removed from the pool, and traffic will not be forwarded to it until it responds to the health checks again.

There is a variety of load balancing methods, which use different algorithms for different needs.

- Least Connection Method
  - This method directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections. This approach is quite useful when there are a large number of persistent client connections which are unevenly distributed between the servers.
- Least Response Time Method
  - This algorithm directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections and the lowest average response time.
- Least Bandwidth Method
  - This method selects the server that is currently serving the least amount of traffic measured in megabits per second (Mbps).
- Round Robin Method
  - This method cycles through a list of servers and sends each new request to the next server. When it reaches the end of the list, it starts over at the beginning. It is most useful when the servers are of equal specification and there are not many persistent connections.
- Weighted Round Robin Method
  - The weighted round-robin scheduling is designed to better handle servers with different processing capacities. Each server is assigned a weight (an integer value that indicates the processing capacity). Servers with higher weights receive new connections before those with less - weights and servers with higher weights get more connections than those with less weights.
- IP Hash
  - Under this method, a hash of the IP address of the client is calculated to redirect the request to a server.

### Round robin

This algorithm distributes incoming requests to servers in a cyclic order. It assigns a request to the first server, then moves to the second, third, and so on, and after reaching the last server, it starts again at the first.

#### Pros

- Ensures an equal distribution of requests among the servers, as each server gets a turn in a fixed order.
- Easy to implement and understand.
- Works well when servers have similar capacities.

#### Cons

- No Load Awareness
  - Does not take into account the current load or capacity of each server. All servers are treated equally regardless of their current state.
- No Session Affinity
  - Subsequent requests from the same client may be directed to different servers, which can be problematic for stateful applications.
- Performance Issues with Different Capacities
  - May not perform optimally when servers have different capacities or varying workloads.
- Predictable Distribution Pattern
  - Round Robin is predictable in its request distribution pattern, which could potentially be exploited by attackers who can observe traffic patterns and might find vulnerabilities in specific servers by predicting which server will handle their requests.

#### Use cases

- Homogeneous Environments
  - Suitable for environments where all servers have similar capacity and performance.
- Stateless Applications
  - Works well for stateless applications where each request can be handled independently.

  - More complex to implement compared to simpler algorithms like Round Robin, as it requires real-time monitoring of active connections.
- State Maintenance
  - Requires the load balancer to maintain the state of active connections, which can increase overhead.
- Potential for Connection Spikes
  - In scenarios where connection duration is short, servers can experience rapid spikes in connection counts, leading to frequent rebalancing.

#### Use cases

- Heterogeneous Environments
  - Suitable for environments where servers have different capacities and workloads, and the load needs to be dynamically distributed.
- Variable Traffic Patterns
  - Works well for applications with unpredictable or highly variable traffic patterns, ensuring that no single server is overwhelmed.
- Stateful Applications
  - Effective for applications where maintaining session state is important, as it helps distribute active sessions more evenly.

#### Least connections vs round robin

- Round Robin
  - Distributes requests in a fixed, cyclic order without considering the current load on each server.
- Least Connections
  - Distributes requests based on the current load, directing new requests to the server with the fewest active connections.

### Weighted round robin

Weighted Round Robin (WRR) is an enhanced version of the Round Robin load balancing algorithm. It assigns weights to each server based on their capacity or performance, distributing incoming requests proportionally according to these weights. This ensures that more powerful servers handle a larger share of the load, while less powerful servers handle a smaller share.

#### Pros

### IP hash

IP Hash load balancing is a technique that assigns client requests to servers based on the client's IP address. The load balancer uses a hash function to convert the client's IP address into a hash value, which is then used to determine which server should handle the request. This method ensures that requests from the same client IP address are consistently routed to the same server, providing session persistence.

Example:

Suppose you have three servers (Server A, Server B, and Server C) and a client with the IP address 192.168.1.10. The load balancer applies a hash function to this IP address, resulting in a hash value. If the hash value is 2 and there are three servers, the load balancer routes the request to Server C (2 % 3 = 2).

#### Pros

- Session Persistence
  - Ensures that requests from the same client IP address are consistently routed to the same server, which is beneficial for stateful applications.
- Simplicity
  - Easy to implement and does not require the load balancer to maintain the state of connections.
- Deterministic
  - Predictable and consistent routing based on the client's IP address.

#### Cons

- Uneven Distribution
  - If client IP addresses are not evenly distributed, some servers may receive more requests than others, leading to an uneven load.
- Dynamic Changes
  - Adding or removing servers can disrupt the hash mapping, causing some clients to be routed to different servers.
- Limited Flexibility
  - Does not take into account the current load or capacity of servers, which can lead to inefficiencies.

### Least response time

Least Response Time load balancing is a dynamic algorithm that assigns incoming requests to the server with the lowest response time, ensuring efficient utilization of server resources and optimal client experience. This approach aims to direct traffic to the server that can handle the request the fastest, based on recent performance metrics.

#### How least response time works

1. Monitor Response Times
    - The load balancer continuously monitors the response times of each server. Response time is typically measured from when a request is sent to a server until a response is received.
2. Assign Requests
    - When a new request arrives, the load balancer assigns it to the server with the lowest average response time.
3. Dynamic Adjustment
    - The load balancer dynamically adjusts the assignment of requests based on real-time performance data, ensuring that the fastest server handles the next request.

#### Pros

- Optimized Performance
  - Ensures that requests are handled by the fastest available server, leading to reduced latency and improved client experience.
- Dynamic Load Balancing
  - Continuously adjusts to changing server performance, ensuring optimal distribution of load.
- Effective Resource Utilization
  - Helps in better utilization of server resources by directing traffic to servers that can respond quickly.

#### Cons

### Random

Random load balancing is a simple algorithm that distributes incoming requests to servers randomly. Instead of following a fixed sequence or using performance metrics, the load balancer selects a server at random to handle each request. This method can be effective in scenarios where the load is relatively uniform and servers have similar capacities.

Suppose you have three servers: Server A, Server B, and Server C. When a new request arrives, the load balancer randomly chooses one of these servers to handle the request. Over time, if the randomness is uniform, each server should receive approximately the same number of requests.

#### Pros

- Simplicity
  - Very easy to implement and understand, requiring minimal configuration.
- No State Maintenance
  - The load balancer does not need to track the state or performance of servers, reducing overhead.
- Uniform Distribution Over Time
  - If the random selection is uniform, the load will be evenly distributed across servers over a long period.

#### Cons

- No Load Awareness
  - Does not consider the current load or capacity of servers, which can lead to uneven distribution if server performance varies.
- Potential for Imbalance
  - In the short term, random selection can lead to an uneven distribution of requests.
- No Session Affinity
  - Requests from the same client may be directed to different servers, which can be problematic for stateful applications.
- Security systems that rely on detecting anomalies (e.g., to mitigate DDoS attacks) might find it slightly more challenging to identify malicious patterns if a Random algorithm is used, due to the inherent unpredictability in request distribution. This could potentially dilute the visibility of attack patterns.

#### Use Cases

- Homogeneous Environments
  - Suitable for environments where servers have similar capacity and performance.
- Stateless Applications
  - Works well for stateless applications where each request can be handled independently.
- Simple Deployments
  - Ideal for simple deployments where the complexity of other load balancing algorithms is not justified.

### Least bandwidth

The Least Bandwidth load balancing algorithm distributes incoming requests to servers based on the current bandwidth usage. It routes each new request to the server that is consuming the least amount of bandwidth at the time. This approach helps in balancing the network load more efficiently by ensuring that no single server gets overwhelmed with too much data traffic.

Note: 

Bandwidth is a measurement of how much data can be transferred over a network in a given amount of time. It's commonly measured in bits per second (bps), megabits per second (Mbps), or gigabits per second (Gbps). 

Bandwidth is important for understanding the speed and quality of a network, and is especially important for data-intensive activities like online gaming, video conferencing, or large file downloads. When the amount of traffic on a network approaches its capacity, the speed of data transmission will begin to drop.

### Custom load

Custom Load load balancing is a flexible and highly configurable approach that allows you to define your own metrics and rules for distributing incoming traffic across a pool of servers. Unlike standard load balancing algorithms that use predefined criteria such as connection count or response time, Custom Load load balancing enables you to tailor the distribution strategy based on specific requirements and conditions unique to your application or infrastructure.

#### How custom load works

1. Define Custom Metrics
    - Determine the metrics that best represent the load or performance characteristics relevant to your application. These metrics can include CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, application-specific metrics, or a combination of several metrics.

2. Implement Monitoring
    - Continuously monitor the defined metrics on each server in the pool. This may involve integrating with monitoring tools or custom scripts that collect and report the necessary data.

3. Create Load Balancing Rules
    - Establish rules and algorithms that use the monitored metrics to make load balancing decisions. This can be a simple weighted sum of metrics or more complex logic that prioritizes certain metrics over others.

4. Dynamic Adjustment
    - Use the collected data and rules to dynamically adjust the distribution of incoming requests, ensuring that the traffic is balanced according to the custom load criteria.

#### Use Cases

- Complex Applications
  - Ideal for applications with complex performance characteristics and varying resource requirements.
- Highly Dynamic Environments
  - Suitable for environments where workloads and server performance can change rapidly and unpredictably.
- Custom Requirements
  - Useful when standard load balancing algorithms do not meet the specific needs of the application.

## Load balancing use cases

Load balancing is a technique used to distribute workloads evenly across multiple computing resources, such as servers, network links, or other devices, in order to optimize resource utilization, minimize response time, and maximize throughput. This technique helps ensure that no single resource is overwhelmed, thus maintaining a high level of performance and reliability.

### Improving website performance

Load balancing can distribute incoming web traffic among multiple servers, reducing the load on individual servers and ensuring faster response times for end users.

Example: An e-commerce website experiences a sudden surge in traffic during a holiday sale. A load balancer distributes incoming requests among multiple web servers, ensuring that each server handles a manageable number of requests, resulting in faster page load times for users

### Ensuring high availability and reliability

By distributing the workload among multiple servers, load balancing helps prevent single points of failure. If one server fails or experiences an issue, the load balancer can redirect traffic to other available servers, maintaining uptime and minimizing service disruptions.

Example: A banking application relies on several servers to handle user transactions. The load balancer monitors the health of each server and, in the event of a server failure, redirects traffic to the remaining healthy servers, minimizing downtime and maintaining user access to the application.

### Scalability

Load balancing allows organizations to easily scale their infrastructure as traffic and demand increase. Additional servers can be added to the load balancing pool to accommodate increased demand, without the need for significant infrastructure changes.

Example: A video streaming platform sees a steady increase in users as it gains popularity. To handle the growing demand, the platform adds new servers to the load balancing pool, allowing it to scale seamlessly without overloading existing infrastructure.

### Redundancy

Load balancing can be used to maintain redundant copies of data and services across multiple servers, reducing the risk of data loss or service outages due to hardware failure or other issues.

Example: An online file storage service uses load balancing to maintain multiple copies of user data across different servers. If one server experiences a hardware failure, users can still access their data from the redundant copies stored on other servers.

### Network optimization

Load balancing can help optimize network traffic by distributing it across multiple paths or links, reducing congestion and improving overall network performance.

Example: A large organization has multiple internet connections to handle its network traffic. A load balancer distributes the incoming and outgoing traffic across these connections, reducing congestion and improving overall network performance.

### Geographic distribution

For global organizations, load balancing can be used to distribute traffic across data centers in different geographic locations. This ensures that users are directed to the nearest or best-performing data center, reducing latency and improving user experience.

Example: A multinational company has data centers in North America, Europe, and Asia. A load balancer directs users to the nearest data center based on their geographic location, reducing latency and improving the user experience.

### Application performance

Load balancing can be used to distribute requests for specific applications or services among dedicated servers or resources, ensuring that each application or service receives the necessary resources to perform optimally.

Example: An enterprise uses a suite of applications, including email, file storage, and collaboration tools. A load balancer assigns dedicated resources to each application, ensuring that each service performs optimally without affecting the performance of other applications.

### Security

Load balancers can help protect against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks by distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers, making it more difficult for attackers to overwhelm a single target.

Example: A news website faces a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, with a large number of malicious requests targeting its servers. The load balancer distributes the traffic among multiple servers, making it more difficult for the attackers to overwhelm a single target and mitigating the impact of the attack.

### Cost savings

By distributing workloads across available resources more efficiently, load balancing can help organizations save money on hardware and infrastructure costs, as well as reduce energy consumption.

Example: A small business utilizes cloud-based infrastructure for its web applications. By using load balancing to optimize resource usage, the business can minimize the number of servers needed, resulting in lower infrastructure and energy costs.

### Content caching

Some load balancers can cache static content, such as images and videos. This cached content is then served directly from the load balancer, reducing the demand on the servers and providing faster response times for users.

Example: In a streaming service like Netflix, users access a wide variety of content like TV shows, movies, etc. Now, consider a very popular TV show that millions of users might want to watch. If each request for this show was routed to the servers, it would result in a huge load on the servers, potentially slowing down response times or even leading to server failure. By caching such popular content on the load balancer, the streaming service can drastically reduce the load on its main servers.

## Load balancer types

Different load balancing types are designed to meet various requirements and can be implemented using hardware, software, or cloud-based solutions. Each load balancing type has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, making it suitable for specific scenarios and use cases. Some common load balancing types include hardware load balancing, software load balancing, cloud-based load balancing, DNS load balancing, and Layer 4 and Layer 7 load balancing. By understanding the different load balancing types and their characteristics, you can select the most appropriate solution for your specific needs and infrastructure.

#### Pros

- Fast and efficient, as it makes decisions based on limited information from the transport layer.
- Can handle a wide variety of protocols and traffic types.
- Relatively simple to implement and manage.

#### Cons

- Lacks awareness of application-level information, which may limit its effectiveness in some scenarios.
- No consideration for server health, response time, or resource utilization.
- May not be suitable for applications requiring session persistence or fine-grained load distribution.

Example: An online gaming platform uses Layer 4 load balancing to distribute game server traffic based on IP addresses and port numbers, ensuring that players are evenly distributed among available game servers for smooth gameplay.

### Layer 7 load balancing

Layer 7 load balancing, also known as application layer load balancing, operates at the application layer of the OSI model (the seventh layer). It takes into account application-specific information, such as HTTP headers, cookies, and URL paths, to make more informed decisions about how to distribute incoming traffic.

#### Pros

- Provides more intelligent and fine-grained load balancing, as it considers application-level information.
- Can support advanced features, such as session persistence, content-based routing, and SSL offloading.
- Can be tailored to specific application requirements and protocols.

#### Cons

- Can be slower and more resource-intensive compared to Layer 4 load balancing, as it requires deeper inspection of incoming traffic.
- May require specialized software or hardware to handle application-level traffic inspection and processing.
- Potentially more complex to set up and manage compared to other load balancing techniques.

Example: A web application with multiple microservices uses Layer 7 load balancing to route incoming API requests based on the URL path, ensuring that each microservice receives only the requests it is responsible for handling.

## Stateless vs stateful load balancing

### Stateless load balancing

Stateless load balancers operate without maintaining any information about the clients' session or connection state. They make routing decisions based solely on the incoming request data, such as the client's IP address, request URL, or other headers. Because stateless load balancers do not store session information, they can quickly and efficiently distribute incoming traffic without considering the clients' history or past interactions with the application.

Example: Consider a web application that enables users to search for products according to their location. A stateless load balancer can allocate requests to servers based on the user's geographic location, without retaining any session data.

### Stateful load balancing

In contrast, stateful load balancing preserves session information between requests. The load balancer assigns a client to a specific server and ensures that all subsequent requests from the same client are directed to that server. This method is beneficial when requests pertain to a particular session and necessitate session data.

Example: Suppose a web application that requires users to log in to access their personal information. A stateful load balancer can guarantee that requests from the same user are routed to the same server, allowing session data such as login credentials to be available.

Stateful load balancing can be further categorized into two types:

- Source IP Affinity
  - This form of stateful load balancing assigns a client to a specific server based on the client's IP address. While this approach ensures that requests from the same client consistently reach the same server, it may pose issues if the client's IP address frequently changes, such as in mobile networks.

- Session Affinity
  - In this type of stateful load balancing, the load balancer allocates a client to a specific server based on a session identifier, such as a cookie or URL parameter. This method ensures that requests from the same client consistently reach the same server, regardless of the client's IP address.

Ultimately, the decision between stateless and stateful load balancing depends on the application or service's requirements. Stateless load balancing is useful for applications capable of processing requests independently, while stateful load balancing is more appropriate for applications that depend on session data.

## High availability and fault tolerance

### Failover strategies for load balancers

To ensure high availability and fault tolerance, load balancers should be designed and deployed with redundancy in mind. This means having multiple instances of load balancers that can take over if one fails. Redundancy can be achieved through several failover strategies:

- Active-passive configuration
  - In this setup, one load balancer (the active instance) handles all incoming traffic while the other (the passive instance) remains on standby. If the active load balancer fails, the passive instance takes over and starts processing requests. This configuration provides a simple and reliable failover mechanism but does not utilize the resources of the passive instance during normal operation.

- Active-active configuration
  - In this setup, multiple load balancer instances actively process incoming traffic simultaneously. Traffic is distributed among the instances using methods such as DNS load balancing or an additional load balancer layer. If one instance fails, the others continue to process traffic with minimal disruption. This configuration provides better resource utilization and increased fault tolerance compared to the active-passive setup.

### Health checks and monitoring for load balancers

Effective health checks and monitoring are essential components of high availability and fault tolerance for load balancers. Health checks are periodic tests performed by the load balancer to determine the availability and performance of backend servers. By monitoring the health of backend servers, load balancers can automatically remove unhealthy servers from the server pool and avoid sending traffic to them, ensuring a better user experience and preventing cascading failures.

Monitoring the load balancer itself is also crucial. By keeping track of performance metrics, such as response times, error rates, and resource utilization, we can detect potential issues and take corrective action before they lead to failures or service degradation.

In addition to regular health checks and monitoring, it is essential to have proper alerting and incident response procedures in place. This ensures that the appropriate personnel are notified of any issues and can take action to resolve them quickly.

### Synchronization and state sharing for load balancers

In active-active and active-passive configurations, it is crucial to ensure that the load balancer instances maintain a consistent view of the system's state, including the status of backend servers, session data, and other configuration settings. This can be achieved through various mechanisms, such as:

- Centralized configuration management
  - Using a centralized configuration store (e.g., etcd, Consul, or ZooKeeper) to maintain and distribute configuration data among load balancer instances ensures that all instances are using the same settings and are aware of changes.

- State sharing and replication
  - In scenarios where load balancers must maintain session data or other state information, it is crucial to ensure that this data is synchronized and replicated across instances. This can be achieved through database replication, distributed caching systems (e.g., Redis or Memcached), or built-in state-sharing mechanisms provided by the load balancer software or hardware.

## Load balancer scalability and performance

### Horizontal and vertical scaling of load balancers

As traffic to an application increases, it is essential to ensure that the load balancer can handle the increased demand. There are two primary methods for scaling load balancers:

- Horizontal scaling
  - This involves adding more load balancer instances to distribute traffic among them. Horizontal scaling is particularly effective for active-active configurations, where each load balancer instance actively processes traffic. Horizontal scaling can be achieved using DNS load balancing or by implementing an additional load balancer layer to distribute traffic among the instances.

- Vertical scaling
  - This involves increasing the resources (e.g., CPU, memory, and network capacity) of the existing load balancer instance(s) to handle increased traffic. Vertical scaling is often limited by the maximum capacity of a single instance, which is why horizontal scaling is typically preferred for large-scale applications.

### Rate limiting on load balancers

Managing the number of connections and request rates is crucial for optimizing the performance of load balancers. Overloading a load balancer or backend servers can result in decreased performance or even service outages. Implementing rate limiting and connection limits at the load balancer level can help prevent overloading and ensure consistent performance.

Load balancers can enforce rate limits based on various criteria, such as IP addresses, client domains, or URL patterns. Implementing these limits can also help mitigate the impact of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and prevent individual clients from monopolizing resources.

### Caching on load balancers

Caching and content optimization can significantly improve the performance of load-balanced applications. Load balancers can cache static content, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files, to reduce the load on backend servers and improve response times. Additionally, some load balancers support content optimization features like compression or minification, which can further improve performance and reduce bandwidth consumption.

### Latency with load balancers

Introducing a load balancer into the request-response path adds an additional network hop, which can result in increased latency. While the impact is typically minimal, it is important to consider the potential latency introduced by the load balancer and optimize its performance accordingly.

Optimizing the performance of the load balancer can be achieved through various strategies, including:

- Geographical distribution
  - Deploying load balancers and backend servers in geographically distributed locations can help reduce latency for users by ensuring that their requests are processed by a nearby instance.

- Connection reuse
  - Many load balancers support connection reuse or keep-alive connections, which reduce the overhead of establishing new connections between the load balancer and backend servers for each request.

- Protocol optimizations
  - Some load balancers support protocol optimizations, such as HTTP/2 or QUIC, which can improve performance by reducing latency and increasing throughput.

## Challenges of load balancers

### SPOF

If not designed with redundancy and fault tolerance in mind, a load balancer can become a single point of failure in the system. If the load balancer experiences an outage, it could impact the entire application.

- Remedy
  - Implement high availability and failover mechanisms, such as redundant load balancer instances, to ensure continuity even if one instance fails.

### Configuration complexity

Load balancers often come with a wide range of configuration options, including algorithms, timeouts, and health checks. Misconfigurations can lead to poor performance, uneven traffic distribution, or even service outages.

- Remedy
  - Regularly review and update configurations, and consider using automated configuration tools or expert consultation to ensure optimal settings.

### Scalability limitations

As traffic increases, the load balancer itself might become a performance bottleneck, especially if it is not configured to scale horizontally or vertically.

- Remedy
  - Plan for horizontal or vertical scaling of the load balancer to match traffic demands, and use scalable cloud-based load balancing solutions.

### Latency

Introducing a load balancer into the request-response path adds an additional network hop, which could lead to increased latency. While the impact is typically minimal, it is essential to consider the potential latency introduced by the load balancer and optimize its performance accordingly.

- Remedy
  - Optimize load balancer performance through efficient routing algorithms and by placing the load balancer geographically close to the majority of users.

### Sticky sessions

Some applications rely on maintaining session state or user context between requests. In such cases, load balancers must be configured to use session persistence or "sticky sessions" to ensure subsequent requests from the same user are directed to the same backend server. However, this can lead to uneven load distribution and negate some of the benefits of load balancing.

- Remedy
  - Employ advanced load balancing techniques that balance the need for session persistence with even traffic distribution, or redesign the application to reduce dependence on session state.

### Cost

Deploying and managing load balancers, especially in high-traffic scenarios, can add to the overall cost of your infrastructure. This may include hardware or software licensing costs, as well as fees associated with managed load balancing services provided by cloud providers.

- Remedy
  - Opt for cost-effective load balancing solutions, such as open-source software or cloud-based services that offer pay-as-you-go pricing models.

### Health checks and monitoring

Implementing effective health checks for backend servers is essential to ensure that the load balancer accurately directs traffic to healthy instances. Misconfigured or insufficient health checks can lead to the load balancer sending traffic to failed or underperforming servers, resulting in a poor user experience.

- Remedy
  - Implement comprehensive and regular health checks for backend servers, and use real-time monitoring tools to ensure traffic is always directed to healthy instances.

## Redundant load balancers

The load balancer can be a single point of failure; to overcome this, a second load balancer can be connected to the first to form a cluster. Each LB monitors the health of the other and, since both of them are equally capable of serving traffic and failure detection, in the event the main load balancer fails, the second load balancer takes over.

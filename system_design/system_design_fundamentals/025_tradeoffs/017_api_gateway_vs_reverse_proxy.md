# API gateway vs reverse proxy

API Gateway and Reverse Proxy are both architectural components that manage incoming requests, but they serve different purposes and operate in somewhat different contexts.

## API gateway

An API Gateway is a management tool that acts as a single entry point for a defined group of microservices, handling requests and routing them to the appropriate service.

### Functionality

- Routing
  - Routes requests to the correct microservice.
- Aggregation
  - Aggregates results from multiple microservices.
- Cross-Cutting Concerns
  - Handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and logging.
- Protocol Translation
  - Can translate between web protocols (HTTP, WebSockets) and backend protocols.

### Use cases

Typically used in microservices architectures to provide a unified interface to a set of independently deployable services.

### Example

In a microservices-based e-commerce application, the API Gateway would be the single entry point for all client requests. It would handle user authentication, then route product search requests to the search service, cart management requests to the cart service, etc.

## Reverse proxy

A Reverse Proxy is a type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers. It sits between the client and the backend services or servers.

### Functionality

- Load Balancing
  - Distributes client requests across multiple servers to balance load and ensure reliability.
- Security
  - Provides an additional layer of defense (hides the identities of backend servers).
- Caching
  - Can cache content to reduce server load and improve performance.
- SSL Termination
  - Handles SSL encryption and decryption, offloading that responsibility from backend servers.

### Use cases

Commonly used in both monolithic and microservices architectures to enhance security, load balancing, and caching.

### Example

A website with high traffic might use a reverse proxy to distribute requests across multiple application servers, cache content for faster retrieval, and manage SSL connections.

## API gateway vs reverse proxy

### Primary Role

- An API Gateway primarily facilitates and manages application-level traffic, acting as a gatekeeper for microservices.
- A Reverse Proxy focuses more on network-level concerns like load balancing, security, and caching for a wider range of applications.

### Complexity and Functionality

- API Gateways are more sophisticated in functionality, often providing additional features like request transformation, API orchestration, and rate limiting.
- Reverse Proxies tend to be simpler and more focused on network and server efficiency and security.

While both API Gateways and Reverse Proxies manage traffic, they cater to different needs. An API Gateway is more about managing, routing, and orchestrating API calls in a microservices architecture, whereas a Reverse Proxy is about general server efficiency, security, and network traffic management. In practice, many modern architectures might use both, with an API Gateway handling application-specific routing and a Reverse Proxy managing general traffic and security concerns.

# Proxy vs reverse proxy

Proxy and Reverse Proxy are both intermediary entities in a network that manage and redirect traffic, but they differ in terms of their operational setup and the direction in which they handle traffic.

## Proxy (Forward proxy)

A Proxy, often referred to as a Forward Proxy, serves as an intermediary for requests from clients (like browsers) seeking resources from other servers. The clients connect to the proxy server, which then forwards the request to the destination server on behalf of the client.

### Functionality

- Privacy and Anonymity
  - Hides the identity of the client from the internet servers they are accessing. The server sees the proxy’s IP address, not the client’s.
- Content Filtering and Censorship
  - Can be used to control and restrict access to specific websites or content.
- Caching
  - May cache responses to reduce loading times and bandwidth usage for frequently accessed resources.

### Example

In an organizational network, a forward proxy is used to control internet access, where all employee web requests go through the proxy. The proxy blocks certain websites and caches frequently accessed resources to improve speed and reduce external bandwidth usage.

## Reverse proxy

A Reverse Proxy, in contrast, is an intermediary for requests from clients (external or internal) directed to one or more servers. The clients connect to the reverse proxy server, which then forwards the request to the appropriate backend server.

### Functionality

- Load Balancing
  - Distributes incoming requests evenly among multiple servers to balance the load.
- Security and Anonymity for Servers
  - Hides the identities of the backend servers from the clients, providing an additional security layer.
- SSL Termination
  - Handles SSL encryption and decryption, offloading that responsibility from the backend servers.
- Caching and Compression
  - Improves performance by caching content and compressing server responses.

### Example

A high-traffic website uses a reverse proxy to manage incoming user requests. The proxy distributes traffic among various servers (load balancing), caches content for faster retrieval, and provides SSL encryption for secure communications.

## Proxy vs reverse proxy

### Direction of Traffic

- A Proxy (Forward Proxy) acts on behalf of clients (users), managing outbound requests to the internet or other networks.
- A Reverse Proxy acts on behalf of servers, managing inbound requests from the outside to the server infrastructure.

### Intended Purpose

- Proxies are typically used for client privacy, internet access control, and caching.
- Reverse Proxies are used for server load balancing, security, performance enhancement, and as an additional layer in the server architecture.

While both Proxy and Reverse Proxy serve as intermediaries in network traffic, their roles are essentially opposite. A Proxy is client-facing, managing outgoing traffic and user access, while a Reverse Proxy is server-facing, managing incoming traffic to the server infrastructure. Their deployment and specific functionalities reflect these distinct roles.

# Latency vs throughput

## Latency

Latency measures delay—how long it takes for a single request to be processed from start to finish. In other words, it's the delay between the initiation of a request and the receipt of the response. Think of it as the time you wait at a fast-food drive-thru to get your order.

### Characteristics

- Measured in units of time (milliseconds, seconds).
- Lower latency indicates a more responsive system.

### Impact

Latency is particularly important in scenarios where real-time or near-real-time interaction or data transfer is crucial, such as in online gaming, video conferencing, or high-frequency trading.

### Example

If you click a link on a website, the latency would be the time it takes from the moment you click the link to when the page starts loading.

## Throughput

Throughput refers to the amount of data transferred over a network or processed by a system in a given amount of time. It's a measure of how much work or data processing is completed over a specific period.

### Characteristics

- Measured in units of data per time (e.g., Mbps - Megabits per second).
- Higher throughput indicates a higher data processing capacity.

### Impact

Throughput is a critical measure in systems where the volume of data processing is significant, such as in data backup systems, bulk data processing, or video streaming services.

### Example

In a video streaming service, throughput would be the rate at which video data is transferred from the server to your device.

## Latency vs throughput

Low latency is crucial for applications requiring fast response times, while high throughput is vital for systems dealing with large volumes of data.

- Focus
  - Latency is about the delay or time, focusing on speed. Throughput is about the volume of work or data, focusing on capacity.
- Influence on User Experience
  - High latency can lead to a sluggish user experience, while low throughput can result in slow data transfer rates, affecting the efficiency of data-intensive operations.
- Trade-offs
  - In some systems, improving throughput may increase latency, and vice versa. For instance, sending data in larger batches may improve throughput but could also result in higher latency.

## How to improve latency

- Optimize Network Routes
  - Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to serve content from locations geographically closer to the user. This reduces the distance data must travel, decreasing latency.
- Caching Frequently Accessed Data
  - Cache frequently accessed data in memory to eliminate the need to fetch data from the original source repeatedly.
- Upgrade Hardware
  - Faster processors, more memory, and quicker storage (like SSDs) can reduce processing time.
- Use Faster Communication Protocols
  - Protocols like HTTP/2 can reduce latency through features like multiplexing and header compression.
- Database Optimization
  - Use indexing, optimized queries, and in-memory databases to reduce data access and processing time.
- Load Balancing
  - Distribute incoming requests efficiently among servers to prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck.
- Code Optimization
  - Optimize algorithms and remove unnecessary computations to speed up execution.
- Minimize External Calls
  - Reduce the number of API calls or external dependencies in your application.

## How to improve throughput

- Scale Horizontally
  - Add more servers to handle increased load. This is often more effective than vertical scaling (upgrading the capacity of a single server).
- Implement Caching
  - Cache frequently accessed data in memory to reduce the need for repeated data processing.
- Parallel Processing
  - Use parallel computing techniques where tasks are divided and processed simultaneously.
- Batch Processing
  - For non-real-time data, processing in batches can be more efficient than processing each item individually.
- Optimize Database Performance
  - Ensure efficient data storage and retrieval. This may include techniques like partitioning and sharding.
- Asynchronous Processing
  - Use asynchronous processes for tasks that don’t need to be completed immediately.
- Network Bandwidth
  - Increase the network bandwidth to accommodate higher data transfer rates.

# SSE

Server side events is a mechanism that allows servers to push updates to clients over a long-lived HTTP connection. It's built on top of HTTP/1.1 and provides a unidirectional stream of data from the server to the client. Here's a comprehensive guide on how a client establishes a connection to use SSE and the responses the server sends back.

## Establishing a connection for SSE

### Clients will first send an HTTP GET request to the server to establish a connection for SSE

```http
GET /events HTTP/1.1
Accept: text/event-stream
Connection: keep-alive
```

- Accept
  - text/event-stream: Indicates that the client expects an SSE data stream.
- Connection
  - keep-alive: Keeps the connection open for continuous updates.

### Implementation on the client-side using EventSource API

In modern web applications, the client will usually use JS to receive SSE events after sending the GET request to establish the connection. The EventSource API provides a simple way to do this:

```js
const eventSource = new EventSource("/events")

eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log("Message from server: ", event.data)
}

eventSource.onerror = (error) => {
  console.error("Error from server: ", error)
}
```

### After the client sends a request at the endpoint /events, the server will respond as follows

Once the client establishes a connection, the server responds and starts sending events in the text/event-stream format.

The server responds with an HTTP 200 status and the Content-Type header set to text/event-stream

The server also sends events in a structured text-based format. Each event consists of one or more lines, ending with a blank line. The fields in an event includes:

- data
  - The actual payload sent to the client (JSON is common).
  - The event payload (required).
- id
  - Unique ID for the event. Clients can use this for reconnection.
  - The event ID (optional, for reconnection purposes).
- event
  - message: The type of the event (optional, defaults to message).
  - The event type (optional).
- retry
  - Time in milliseconds the client should wait before reconnecting after a connection loss (optional).

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/event-stream
Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: keep-alive
{
  id: 101
  event: update
  data: {"status": "connected", "timestamp": "2024-12-27T10:00:00Z"}
  
  id: 102
  data: {"message": "Hello, client!"}
  
  retry: 5000
}
```

- Content-Type
  - text/event-stream: Specifies the format of the response as an SSE data stream.
- Cache-Control
  - “no-cache” means that a browser may cache a response, but it must first send a validation request to an origin server before caching it. 
- Connection
  - keep-alive: Keeps the connection open for continuous streaming.

Multiple lines of data can also be sent for a single event:

```bash
data: This is line 1
data: This is line 2
```

## Server side implementation of SSE

### Below is a server side implementation of SSE at the /events endpoint

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const PORT = 3000;

// Middleware to handle the SSE connection
app.get('/events', (req, res) => {
    // Set headers to establish an SSE connection
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/event-stream');
    res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-cache');
    res.setHeader('Connection', 'keep-alive');

    console.log('Client connected to /events');

    // Send a welcome message immediately after the connection
    res.write('id: 1\n');
    res.write('event: welcome\n');
    res.write('data: {"message": "Welcome to the SSE stream!"}\n\n');

    // Function to send data every 3 seconds
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
        const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
        res.write(`id: ${Date.now()}\n`);
        res.write('event: update\n');
        res.write(`data: {"timestamp": "${timestamp}", "status": "active"}\n\n`);
    }, 3000);

    // Handle client disconnection
    req.on('close', () => {
        console.log('Client disconnected from /events');
        clearInterval(interval);
        res.end();
    });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`SSE server running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

- Heartbeat / Updates
  - Periodically sends data (every 3 seconds in this case) to keep the connection alive and update the client.

- Client Disconnect Handling
  - Listens for the close event on the request object and cleans up resources when the client disconnects.

## Full client side implementation of establishing SSE

We can connect to the SSE server on the client using the below implementation:

```js
const eventSource = new EventSource('http://localhost:3000/events');

eventSource.onopen = () => {
    console.log('Connected to the server');
};

eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
    console.log('Default event received:', event.data);
};

eventSource.addEventListener('welcome', (event) => {
    console.log('Welcome event received:', JSON.parse(event.data));
});

eventSource.addEventListener('update', (event) => {
    console.log('Update event received:', JSON.parse(event.data));
});

eventSource.onerror = (error) => {
    console.error('SSE error:', error);
};
```

If using node, then use the following:

```js
const { EventSource } = require("eventsource")
const eventSource = new EventSource('http://localhost:3000/events');

eventSource.onopen = () => {
  console.log('Connected to the server');
};

// the below will listen for the default events:
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('Default event received:', event.data);
};

// the below will listen for a "welcome" event:
eventSource.addEventListener('welcome', (event) => {
  console.log('Welcome event received:', JSON.parse(event.data));
});

// the below will listen for the "update" events:
eventSource.addEventListener('update', (event) => {
  console.log('Update event received:', JSON.parse(event.data));
});

// if there was an error, this the below function will be triggered:
eventSource.onerror = (error) => {
  console.error('SSE error:', error);
};
```

The output on the client-side may look as follows:

```bash
Connected to the server
Welcome event received: { message: "Welcome to the SSE stream!" }
Update event received: { timestamp: "2024-12-27T12:00:00.000Z", status: "active" }
```

## Reconnecting in SSE

If the connection drops, the browser automatically reconnects using the EventSource API. The client sends an Last-Event-ID header in the request to resume from the last event it received:

```http
GET /events HTTP/1.1
Accept: text/event-stream
Last-Event-ID: 102
```

- Last-Event-ID
  - The server can use the Last-Event-ID to resume sending events from where the connection was lost

## SSE best practices

- Keep Connections Alive
  - Periodically send a "heartbeat" event to prevent timeouts:

```bash
data: heartbeat
```

- Use Retry Mechanism
  - Set the retry field to a reasonable value to ensure robust reconnections.

- Efficient Event Management
  - Use id to track the last sent event for reconnections.
  - Utilize event to define event types for different kinds of messages.

- Security
  - Use HTTPS for secure communication.
  - Authenticate clients using tokens in headers or query parameters.

- Scalability
  - Use scalable architectures like reverse proxies (e.g., NGINX) or push services (e.g., AWS API Gateway, Pub/Sub) to handle many concurrent SSE connections.
